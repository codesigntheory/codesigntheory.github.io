One day, we started a project, a jewellary e-commerce. It was more about of honor and keeping promise than money. We rolled on.

We chose our stack carefully, for speed and elegance. Overcame numerous of challanges. One of those was properly showing solitaire's details in that site by pulling the data from Rapnet's API. We thought caching the data in our server would be a good idea. So we studied the documentation and found the whole thing is a mess!

To make our life easier, we solved the Rapnet API problem for once and for all, for us and eventually for everyone. Thus, instead of a 'script' for our own, of marely 100 lines of code, we made a full-fledged library for python to cover every use-cases. It covers both username-password and token based authentication, All sort of API interactions.

Of course the library is not perfect! But, it is a start for us, and maybe for many developers. It is our small tribute to Opensource community, the community that gave us much more.
